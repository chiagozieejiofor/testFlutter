# testFlutter
Design assignment.

The Task

● You are to come up with a mobile translation of the dribble design.

● All the pages shown in the video only (URL link) are to be implemented.

● Make sure to imitate all the scroll behaviors, effects and animations as accurately as you can.

What to Look Out For

A design for a sample product website was picked at random from Dribbble (URL above).

How well you do will be based on both the accuracy of your translation efforts (i.e. how close the result looks compared to the actual design) and the quality of your animations (i.e. the movement of elements on the page compared to the video on Dribbble).

The test is very objective, the closer you are to the source material, the higher your chances of passing the test.

This is also to test your ‘pure’ translation skills i.e how well you can copy a pure design. In practice you would be translating from say a Figma file. But we want to be sure you can accurately translate given any medium.
